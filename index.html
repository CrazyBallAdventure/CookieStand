            <h2> Our Story </h2>
            <p>In the early 2000s, Patrick and Patrice Fishe were living in Seattle while Patrick worked in marketing. Patrice loved the city's vibrant food scene, especially the abundance of fresh seafood available at Pike Place Market. One day, while browsing the market's stalls, she noticed a gap in the market: there were no sweet treats inspired by the local salmon. <br>

            Patrice had always enjoyed baking and experimenting with new recipes, so she decided to take matters into her own hands. She spent months tinkering with a cookie recipe that would capture the essence of salmon without being too fishy. Eventually, she landed on a buttery, lightly sweetened cookie that was shaped like a whole salmon. <br>
                
            Patrice started selling her salmon-shaped cookies at local farmers' markets and food festivals. They were an instant hit, with customers raving about the clever design and delicious taste. Patrice realized she might be onto something, and with the help of her husband, decided to take the leap and open their own cookie shop. <br>
                
            In 2005, Patrice opened the first Salmon Cookie Co. store in downtown Seattle. The shop was a cozy space decorated with nautical touches, and featured a variety of salmon-themed cookies, from classic fillets to playful cartoon fish. The cookies were all handmade in small batches using local ingredients, and the shop quickly became a favorite among locals and tourists alike. <br>

            Today, Salmon Cookie Co. has several locations throughout Seattle, as well as an online store that ships cookies all over the world. Patrice and Patrick are proud to have created a unique business that celebrates their love for Seattle and its delicious seafood choices, specifically the salmon! They continue to innovate and experiment with new flavors and designs, while staying true to their commitment to using only the best ingredients and supporting their local community.
